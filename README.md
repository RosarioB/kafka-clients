# kafka-clients
I have grouped in this repository some examples of producers, consumers trying to explore the different possibilities that Kafka has to offer. 

The file docker-compose.yml, which contains the kafka infrastructure and all its services, has been used with all clients and it has been taken [here](https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-all-in-one/blob/7.4.0-post/cp-all-in-one/docker-compose.yml) .

There are different branches with different purposes:

- ***consumer-producer***: basic producers which reads data from and a basic consumer which reads the data produced by the producer.
